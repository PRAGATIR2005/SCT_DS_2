Titanic Dataset - Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Objective:-
In this project, the goal is to perform *Data Cleaning* and *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)* on a dataset of your choice, specifically the *Titanic dataset* from Kaggle. The purpose is to uncover relationships between different variables in the dataset and identify any trends or patterns that could provide valuable insights.
Features:-
- Data Cleaning: This involves tasks like handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing the data where necessary.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The dataset is explored through various visualizations and statistical summaries to understand the relationships between variables.
- Data Insights: By analyzing the dataset, we can identify trends, such as survival rates by factors like gender, age, and class.
Tools:-
- Python: Used to manipulate and analyze the data.
- *Pandas*: A Python library for cleaning and transforming data, including handling missing values.
- *Matplotlib & Seaborn*: These libraries are used to create visualizations to better understand the data.
- *Jupyter Notebook/Colab*: Interactive environments for running Python code and documenting the analysis.
- *Kaggle Titanic Dataset*: The dataset used for this analysis, available on Kaggle.
 Conclusion:-
By completing this project, you'll have not only cleaned the Titanic dataset but also explored it to identify key insights. For example, youâ€™ll be able to see how variables like age, gender, and passenger class affected survival rates. These insights lay the groundwork for further analysis or could even be used in machine learning models to predict survival on the Titanic.
